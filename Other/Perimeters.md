# perimeters

## Definition
A perimeter in technical Minecraft is much different from how the word is otherwise used. In math, the perimeter of a 2-dimensional shape is the distance around its edges. In technical Minecraft, a perimeter is a region where all blocks have been completely removed or lit up. This decreases the lag impact of the region and, importantly, prevents mobs from filling up the mob cap and decreasing the rates of any farms built up in the area.The minimum perimeter has all blocks within 128 meters of the player completely removed (forming a sphere). 

## History
The first known perimeter to be constructed was on the ZipKrowd server. They wanted more efficiency from their quadruple witch farms, so they decided to remove all of the blocks around the AFK location, where other mobs may be able to spawn and fill up the mobcap. Perimeter creation has become significantly easier since the advent of movable TNT duping
