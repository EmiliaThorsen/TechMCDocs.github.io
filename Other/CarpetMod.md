# carpet mod

Popular technical Minecraft player Gnembon created Carpet Mod as a tool for testing farms in creative mode.
## History
 It was named as "Carpet Mod" because the mod's functions were originally activated & controlled by placing carpets of different colours. Placing two brown carpets, for example, would measure the distance between them and display it in chat, while placing a pink carpet would print in chat a list of the mobs that could spawn in that location.
