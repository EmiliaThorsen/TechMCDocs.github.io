# chunk loading

## 1.13- chunkloading
todo
## 1.14+ chunkloading
Chunk loading in 1.14 was changed drastically and many ways of chunk loading where changed, in 1.14+ the only way to entity load a chunk is with a player or bot, a portal, the spawn, or the ender dragon fight.
As it's not possible to promote border loaded chunks to entity ticking, remote chunkloading is very limited:

- Or a nether portal line

The spawn chunks where also expanded, it is also worth noting that mobs will now despawn in lazy chunks which removes lazy looting from the game for any mobs that do no have the persistence tag.
